### About this App

This app is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars templating engine to generate the HTML.

 Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the "BURGERS Ready to be served" section -- waiting to be devoured or toss it.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the "Already DEVOURED" section.

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
